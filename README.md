A simple visual approach to explaining pathfinding algorithms.  
Written in python and using pygame to implement graphical interface.  
Written by Jarett Sutula with the help of Professor Brian Gormanly of Marist College.  

### Implementation
Written throughout the 2021 Spring Semester, this project serves as a crucial visualization of various pathfinding algorithms that I have researched and written a thesis paper about. Pathfinding algorithms are harder to understand without some form of visualization, so this project serves to be a way for people interested in pathfinding algorithms to create their own grid with travel nodes and obstacles to better understand how our pathfinding algorithms search and draw paths.  
  
### The 4 algorithms that this project is built around are:
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Dijsktra's Algorithm
* A* (A-Star)

### Project Goals 
Week-by-week I will update these goals, add or remove goals, and highlight progress that has been made.
* ~~Create a basic grid system using pygame's graphical interface.~~
* Allow the user to create start and end nodes on the grid that the algorithms will traverse between.
* Allow the user to create obstacles on the grid that the algorithms have to traverse around.
* ~~Allow the user to clear the grid.~~
* Implement BFS.
* Implement DFS.
* Implement Dijsktra's Algorithm.
* Implement A*.
* Allow the user to press a button to go step-by-step through the algorithm's process.
* Add UI buttons to clear grid, change algorithms, etc.
